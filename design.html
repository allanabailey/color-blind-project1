                <h2>Inclusive Design Considerations</h2>
                <div id="design-blurb">
                    <p>
                        It is important to make any graphic, illustration or application as accessible as possible using inclusive design methods. Whether that be a simple poster, logo, or widely used website, it is important that it is as accessible as possible. Whilst there are very technical aspects that can be used within software development that assist screen readers, such as using aria labels, there are some more basic and intuitive design considerations for every day presentation too. When designing anything, it is important to have two or more of the below. For example you could have no icons on a nav bar, as long as there are contrasting colours and something that makes it clear the different menus are clickable. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <!-- Section on Using Icons -->
                <div id="left-design">
                    <img src="assets/images/iconimage.png" alt="An example of an icon with a large circle and tick symbol." class="design-image">
                    <h3>Use Icons</h3>
                    <p>
                        The use of meaningful icons can be incredibly useful to quickly identify the location of links, the meaning of the content within the link, or highlighting the category of information. For example, the home tab of a nav bar might be represented with the classic icon of a house. This means there is no reliance on reading the words within the nav bar, and does not rely on colour cateogrisation.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <!-- Section on Clickable Elements in Design -->
                <div id="right-design">
                    <img src="assets/images/clickimage.png" alt="A picture of a mouse cursor performing a clicking action." class="design-image">
                    <h3>Clickables</h3>
                    <p>
                        When there is a clickable link on a page, either for navigation within the site itself, or refernces to external pages, it is important to make the UI responsive to show it is clickable. For example, links that underline or change colour on hovering on them, or borders appearing around images which zoom on interaction. This change in state on the element makes it clear that it can be interacted with.
                    </p>

                <!-- Section on Contrasting Colours in Design -->

                    <img src="assets/images/contrastimage.png" alt="A picture of a circle containing a different coloured semi-circle within." class="design-image">
                    <h3>Contrasting Colours</h3>
                    <p>
                        Whilst contrasting colours is brilliant for those with colour blindness as it stops similar colours appearing the same, it is also brilliant for standard users without any form of colour vision deficiency too. It can aid navigation and make the most important and active elements stand out to the user. For example, it can highlight the page the user is on on the navigation menu, or clearly separate different sections of the page.

                    <h4>Fun Facts</h4>
                        <p>
                            You can be colour blind in one eye, but have completely regular vision in the other eye.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            All babies are born colour blind, and develop the ability to see colour as they grow.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The mantis shrimp can see 4x the amount of colours than a human can.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Those with colour blindness can often find it difficult to tell the difference between ripened and non-ripe foods.
