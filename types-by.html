                        Tritan colour blindness is caused by either a partial shift, or absence, of the S-Cone responsible for perceiving short light wavelengths and the colour blue. A partial malfunctioning of the cone would result in Tritanomaly, whilst a complete absence of a working cone would result in Tritanopia. Unlike the other forms of colour blindness, Tritan colour blindness is often caused by age-related or environmental factors, and thus appears later on in life in most cases. It can cause a lot of confusion between greens and blues, and red from purples. In the images below, you can see that in the right picture, there is little to no distinction between the red pink and purple flowers seen on the right, whilst all of the green colours look the same or similar shade of grey.

                            You can always speak to a GP or optician about getting a colour blind test, however there are some free ones online you can use.

                    <h4>Fun Facts</h4>
                        <p>
                            You can be colour blind in one eye, but have completely regular vision in the other eye.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            All babies are born colour blind, and develop the ability to see colour as they grow.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The mantis shrimp can see 4x the amount of colours than a human can.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Those with colour blindness can often find it difficult to tell the difference between ripened and non-ripe foods.
