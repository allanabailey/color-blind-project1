# Allana Bailey - Colour Blind Project with Code Institute

## Brief Overview
This website was created as a project for the Code Institute Diploma in Full Stack Software Development.

### Description
A website for people to visit who would like to know more about colour blindness, with clear visual representations of how different forms of colour blindness alter vision. The website also provides information on ways to design web applications in a more inclusive manner for people with colour blindness.

#### Features
The website features a home page with a brief scientific overview of colour blindness, a footer containing links to useful external sources such as colour blind tests and articles, and some fun facts. There are then pages for each main type of colour blindness, a page on design considerations for web developers and anyone creating graphic illsutrations to create more inclusive applications for visually impaired and colour blind users. The final page contains a form that users can submit to help the site gather information on the most desireable colours, what type of user is visiting the site, and to collect details for future correspondence.
