# Allana Bailey - Colour Blind Project with Code Institute

## Brief Overview
This website was created as a project for the Code Institute Diploma in Full Stack Software Development.

### Description
A website for people to visit who would like to know more about colour blindness, with clear visual representations of how different forms of colour blindness alter vision. The website also provides information on ways to design web applications in a more inclusive manner for people with colour blindness.

### Features
The website features a home page with a brief scientific overview of colour blindness, a footer containing links to useful external sources such as colour blind tests and articles, and some fun facts. There are then pages for each main type of colour blindness, a page on design considerations for web developers and anyone creating graphic illsutrations to create more inclusive applications for visually impaired and colour blind users. The final page contains a form that users can submit to help the site gather information on the most desireable colours, what type of user is visiting the site, and to collect details for future correspondence. 

### Goals
Website Goals
* Raise awareness of colour blindness.
* Provide interactive forms of learning and visalisation for different learning types.
* Showcase inclusive design options for web developers and other graphical designers.
* Link to other useful information and articles on the web.

Personal Goals
* Create a website as part of my online portfolio.
* Produce a responsive design suitable for all screen sizes.
* Improve my understanding of colour blindness through research.
* Discover ways to make my own work more inclusive for those with visual impairments.



## Users
Users would visit this website to:
* Find out more about colour blindness.
* Understand a small amount of science behind colour blindness.
* Witness the differences in colour for each type of colour blindness.
* Find out about design considerations that could create a more inclusive web application or graphic.

### User Stories
* As a user who is researching colour blindness, I want to easily see information about colour blindness, so that I can gain more knowledge on the subject.
* As a user with a family member who is colour blind, I want to be able to visualise what they see, so that I can understand their visual deficiency more. 
* As a user who is colour blind, I want a website I can easily see, so that colours donâ€™t prevent me from reading the content.
* As a web designer, I want information on how to create an accessible application, so that all users can enjoy my creations. 



## Planning and Wireframes/MockUps

### Planning Process
I attempted to plan the project in line with the 5 planes of User Centric Design to optimise the User Experience and ensure I didn't fall foul of issues such as scope creep. 

I began by thinking of what content could be useful to web developers and had a keen passion for inclusion and diversity, which led to the idea of creating a website around accessible design. Focussing this further due to limited time and resources, I decided to focus on colour blindness, or colour vision deficiency, as the main focal point of the website. 

I then began to conisder the content that could be achieved which was then scaled down slightly. Originally, there was also going to be an interactive colour picker which showcased how the different colours appeared in each type of colour blindness, but opted to provide a static palette collection and images that could be compared instead.

Following this, I sketched my ideas with pen and paper to logicalise the layout of the site and the priority of content, eventually deciding on Home > Types > Design > Contact with the main content in the pane below. Originally I had the footer information appearing in a customised sidebar for each page, however felt this detracted from the main content and did not always contain vital information important to the page content beside it. Therefore, as it was a lower priority, this information was placed in the footer of the website. This way it was still accessible, but did not take priority over the other content and offered a more modern look to the site.

Following on from this, I used Balsamiq to create wireframes of the different pages to visualise more clearly the location and priority of elements which I then gathered feedback on and adjusted as per feedback.

With regards to the choice of colours and images, it was essential to make the colours accessible and colour blind friendly. Therefore I created a palette of 6 colours which would be suitable and utilised these across the site, with the occasional use of rainbow coloured images to highlight the topic of colour throughout.

### Wireframes
On creating the wireframes, some small changes occurred as a result the difference purposefully shown below. As seen in the images below, originally there was going to be a "Palettes" tab and no "Contact" tab. Having an interactive palettes page was beyond the scope of this project and required technologies not yet covered. Therefore, a decision was made to replace the "Palettes" page with a "Contact" page to prevent overcrowding in the footer and ensure there was an interactive element present.

Wireframes were not created on Balsamiq for responsive screen sizes, but adjusted on paper as they were simplistic changes such as stacking content rather than displaying them in columns.

## Features
* Logo
    * Every page has an **interactive logo** placed at the top of the screen to allow the user to easily return to the home page. The logo uses the **same colour scheme** as the site for consistency. It is placed in a conventional position of top left for desktops, and center top for mobiles for continuity and best practice.

* Nav Bar
    * Every page also has an **interactive nav bar** placed at the top of the screen which is the convention in web design. The nav bar **changes state** by highlighting in a different colour when **active or hovered over** to provide feedback for the user and clarification of which page they are currently viewing.

* Title
    * There is the main website title that appears at the **top of every page**, however below the nav bar, in the content window, each page has its **own title** in a reduced header size to showcase that it is a subtitle and inform the user of the page title.

* Footer
    * Every page has a footer which is split into **two sections**. One section containes **extra information** such as online colour blind tests, fun facts and useful articles, whilst the lower section of the footer contains **copyright information**. Initially social media links were also going to be added, but this did not seem suitable for the website as there is no central social media presence for this content.
